    <p>Sofia cracks open the treasure chest. Inside are slips of paper with six digit numbers on each slip.</p>

    <p>“What’s this?” She asks quizzically. “Nikola, are these what I think they are?”</p>

    <p>“They look like lucky tickets! Look at how many there are, there must be hundreds! Any of them could be a
        winner!”</p>

    <p>“Oh man! We could turn them into the lucky ticket commission and collect the reward! I could pay my Dad back for
        the spaceship!”</p>

    <p>“Er, you didn’t buy it yourself?” Stephen asked Sofia.</p>

    <p>“Well, not as such. I borrowed the money from Dad on the condition that I’d pay him back. Now maybe I can!”</p>

    <p>Stephen sighed. “Well, let’s check the tickets to see if we have a winner.”</p>

    <p>“I have an idea. I brought my number cruncher 5000 along. I’ll just write a quick function to find out if we won
        so we don’t have to do it all manually.” Nikola interjected.</p>

    <p>“Quickly, quickly!” Sofia said hurriedly. “I’m so excited!” </p>
